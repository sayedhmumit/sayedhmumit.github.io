I am an undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology with ongoing research in-
volvement in RNA biology, genomics, immunology, and phytochemistry. Alongside my academic
work, I have been independently exploring theoretical astrophysics since high school, focusing on
gravitational dynamics, black hole behavior, and the relationship between spacetime geometry and
matter. My goal is to build a solid mathematical foundation in classical mechanics, general rel-
ativity, and quantum theory so I can formalize these theoretical ideas into a testable framework.
I have presented research in multiple national and international conferences and have experience
publishing interdisciplinary projects in environmental sustainability and renewable energy. I am
motivated by long-term curiosity, self-driven learning, and a commitment to connecting scientific
understanding across fields
